### JS challenges

The following list is a guide for what type of challenges you should be doing dependent on where you feel you're at.

The first couple are js-drills, that are handed out in two parts. These force you to start getting that muscle memory for the syntax of the language, without much cognitive overhead.

Then there is the callback practice where you are given instructions to install a few node packages (including the one I made), and then get practice in using callbacks. The boilerplate text is in the file, and you just need to carefully follow the instructions.

Following that there is the promises practice which is similar to the callbacks. We also have some browser function practice where you interact with the DOM.

And finally there is the original js-fundamentals (intermediate fundamentals).

So, end to end the list of problems is:

1. Basic and intermediate drills
2. Callback practice
3. Promises practice
4. [Browser function practice](https://github.com/harrisonmalone/harrison-js-challenges)
5. Intermediate fundamentals
